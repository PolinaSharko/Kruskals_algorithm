# Kruskal's algorithm
This project is created for university course work. This is an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm 
(minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest).
I wrote it in C++ and use graphviz for drawing trees.
If you interesting in it or want to use it, or don't understand anything in my code, you can easily reach me (paltiwe@gmail.com)
Also, there are a lot of commentaries in code for Doxygen, so you can remove them if case your need a clear code!
